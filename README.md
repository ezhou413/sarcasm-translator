# Sarcasm Translator

This is a random fun project that converts a String inputted into the program by a user and 'sarcasmifies' it, so you don't have to go through the tedious process of capitalizing *every other* letter in your sentence. 

For example, if your mother asks you how your day was today, normal English would look like this:

```I had a very nice day today```

. . . of course, only if you talk to your mother that nicely. 

On the other hand, I present to you, the 'sarcasmified' version:

```I hAd a vErY NiCe dAy tOdAy```

See? Completely different tone. All done for you by this nifty little program so you don't have to.
